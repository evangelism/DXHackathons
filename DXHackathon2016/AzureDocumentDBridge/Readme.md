##  Goal: Use a robot rover to determine people's emotional state via photographs of their face 


###  Introduction: 


How it works: 

•Raspberry Pi 2+ running Windows 10 IOT core and the robot chassis uses an USB Microsoft Camera.   


◦The camera robot will be able to turn till it detects a face 





### Dev Ops:  


#### Visual Studio Online was used to: 


Track the project from the beginning, pointing out a number of "showstoppers"
 
◾Version control 

◾Test 

◾Collaboration 

#### HockeyApp was used to 
send crash analytics and analyse the usage of the solution



### Productivity: 


Dashboard uses Power BI 

◾Project Oxford reads the Face and then is fed back to the Azure  

◾In Azure the data is consumed by the Mobile Easy App system 


◾The Mobile Easy App system then brings the data into Azure  


◾The Mobile Easy App system passes the data to Power BI 


◾Power BI is used as a dashboard so that the consumer can evaluate and act on the situation 



## Business value: 


Commercial:
